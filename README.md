# SpellChecker-With-a-Dictionary
 To implement a spell checker that determines if a given word is spelled correctly having a dictionary lookup.. When not spelled correctly,it provides a list of similar sounding words based on implementation of the Metaphone algorithm and ordered based on their edit distance from the string that the user typed.. So it would be easier for the user to find the user even he/she has no idea how to spell it.
